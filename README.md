## ClipboardEnhancer

On a daily basis security analysts are constantly copying indicators from one source to another to perform analysis, conduct research, and document findings.
Along the way this information changes forms multiple times and, as a result, means that the user is either using notepad or some other text editor as a working buffer to transform the content.
This is a huge time-sink that can be eliminated by automating the most frequently performed tasks.

Solution Components:
* User Interface
  * Clipboard history
  * Extracted indicators
  * Translation shortcuts
* User configurable indicator rules/types
* User configurable enrichment sources
* User configurable transformations

Common Actions:
* Extract: URLs, domains, hashes, email addresses, UUIDs
* Lookup: Threat feeds, whois, Kusto
* Generate URL hashes
* Translate lists (line delimited to quoted comma delimited)
* Sanitize/remove characters
* De/Refang URLs
