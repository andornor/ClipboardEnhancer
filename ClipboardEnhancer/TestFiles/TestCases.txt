// Email address extraction

Email regex: ([a-zA-Z0-9_\-\.]+)@([a-zA-Z0-9_\-\.]+)\.([a-zA-Z]{2,5})

My email address is bstephan@microsoft.com <- it should be extracted by the ClipboardEnhancer
Other random inputs that this should not extract would be root@localhost or Twitter-like tags @DataScience
Things that look like valid emails but will not hit are: a@a.a or crazy!stuff@yahoo.com or user@my.invalidtld
Other happy email addresses
no-reply@gstatic.com
inspector_gadget@pub.co.uk
vlad@sputnik.ru
not valid but will still get picked up by the regex - well...th@ts.not.right
